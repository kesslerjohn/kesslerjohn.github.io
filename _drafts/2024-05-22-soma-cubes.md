This idea came to me from a book of puzzles written by Martin Gardner in the late 20th century. _TODO: Give book name/link if possible._ The puzzle is made up of 7 pieces - the first of which is composed of 3 cubes, while the remaining 6 are each composed of four cubes. Gardner provides a handy illustration of the puzzle pieces:

I used this as a guide to make my copy of the puzzle. I also needed some wooden blocks - I thought my local antiques store would probably have what I needed. Sure enough, *Artifacts* came through! I found a nice bag of wooden blocks with (mostly) uniform size and design for just \$6, tax included. Before you say I got ripped off, this bag holds 48 red cubes, 3/4" on a side, with numbered faces! (plus two slightly smaller blue cubes, also with numbered faces). A set of 27 3/4" wooden cubes at Lowe's would have cost me around \$10 - and those don't have numbered faces. 

So what's the big deal about numbered faces? It's not a compromise to buy these cubes, because the numbers give me the opportunity to add another level of curiosity to the puzzle; after all, there's a lot you can do with numbers [citation needed]. One thing you can do is add them together.
