Making a Soma Cube Puzzle
======
This idea came to me from a book of puzzles written by Martin Gardner in the late 20th century. _TODO: Give book name/link if possible._ The puzzle is made up of 7 pieces - the first of which is composed of 3 cubes, while the remaining 6 are each composed of four cubes. Gardner provides a handy illustration of the puzzle pieces:
