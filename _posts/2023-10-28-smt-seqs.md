Problem addressed
======
The widely-supported theory of arrays assumes that arrays have fixed size. When reasoning about programs that use arrays, it is important to be able to reason about the length of those arrays. This poses a problem for reasoning about programs that use vectors under this theory, because the size of a vector may change during runtime. 


Background
======
The calculus of sequences presented in this article is based on the calculus for the theory of strings. 

Approach
======

Challenges
------

Description of the calculus
------

Proof of Soundness
------
The authors present a proof that the model and solution are sound, meaning that _when_ a program terminates, it will terminate correctly. 

Implementation in cvc5
