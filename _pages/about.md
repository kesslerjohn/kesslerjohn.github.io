I am a Master's Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Iowa. I have a broad range of experience at the intersection of language and computer science, from natural language processing to programming language design. I am passionate about creating customer-driven software solutions, and I know that in order to achieve success in a fast-paced, constantly-changing environment, clear communication and compromise are key. 

In  my recent work, I have collaborated with research teams from diverse academic backgrounds spanning multiple institutions (The University of Iowa; The University of Wisconsin, Madison; the African Population and Health Research Center; and others) on projects in computational epidemiology and applied machine learning.
