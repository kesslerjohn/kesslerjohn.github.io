I am a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Iowa. I completed my Master's in Linguistics at the same institution. I am currently working with the PATHOME project team on the development of an Agent Based Model to predict which types of social, behavioral, and infrastructure interventions will most efficiently reduce transmission of enteric pathogens in infants.
