I am a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Iowa. I completed my Master's in Linguistics at the same institution. I am currently working with the PATHOME project team on the development of an Agent Based Model to predict which types of social, behavioral, and infrastructure interventions will most efficiently reduce transmission of enteric pathogens in infants. See more about the project [here.](https://sewell.lab.uiowa.edu/pathome)

In my recent work, I have collaborated with research teams from diverse academic backgrounds spanning multiple institutions (The University of Iowa; The University of Wisconsin, Madison; the African Population and Health Research Center; and others) on projects in computational epidemiology and applied machine learning.

I am personally interested in a variety of topics in computer science and elsewhere. Some examples include:
- Theory of programming languages
- Automated Reasoning and Formal Verification
- Natural Language Processing
