I hold a Master of Computer Science and a Master of Arts in Linguistics from the University of Iowa. 
I love technology, math, language, logic, and the natural world. More than a professional portfolio, I intend to use this website to document my explorations in these areas. 
In my recent work, I have collaborated with research teams from diverse academic backgrounds spanning multiple institutions (The African Population and Health Research Center; The University of Iowa; The University of Wisconsin, Madison; and others) on projects in precision medicine, computational epidemiology, and applied machine learning.

I am currently working with the PATHOME project team on the development of Agent-Based Modeling software to predict which types of social, behavioral, and infrastructure interventions will most efficiently reduce transmission of enteric pathogens in infants. See more about the project [here.](https://sewell.lab.uiowa.edu/pathome) 

I am personally interested in a variety of topics in computer science and elsewhere. Some examples include:
- Theory of programming languages
- Automated Reasoning and Formal Verification: I am working on a [Haskell SAT-solver for First Order Logic](https://github.com/kesslerjohn/folley)
- Natural Language Processing
